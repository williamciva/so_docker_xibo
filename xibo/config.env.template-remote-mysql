## CMS Configuration

## Please make a copy of this file as config.env, and then
## edit it to suit your environment

## MYSQL
# You're running with your own remote MySQL server
# Enter the connection details here that Xibo should use
# You'll need to ensure that the database already exists (and is empty)
# and the user specified has all privileges on that database
MYSQL_HOST=mysql.example.org
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DATABASE=example
MYSQL_USER=exampleuser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=examplepassword

# If you wish to connect to MySQL over TLS/SSL connections, set MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA
# to the path on the web server where you have put the CA certificate that has
# signed your MySQL servers certificate. We recommend putting it in the
# shared/cms/custom directory, or you could use a custom volume mount for it
# at your option.
#MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA=/var/www/cms/custom/ca.pem
# If you wish to enforce TLS/SSL connections to your MySQL server, and in the
# process verify the hostname matches the certificate name, set
# MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT to true.
#MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=true

## SMTP Server Configuration
## The CMS needs to be able to send email to you
## Please enter credentials for a suitable SMTP server
## Defaults will work for GMail - replacing your GMail username
## and password as appropriate. You will also need to enable access
## for less secure applications on your GMail account for this to
## work. See https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255

## SMTP Server Hostname
CMS_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com:587
## SMTP Username
CMS_SMTP_USERNAME=youraccount@gmail.com
## SMTP Password
CMS_SMTP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
## Use a TLS Connection YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_USE_TLS=YES
## Use a STARTTLS Connection YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_USE_STARTTLS=YES
## Rewrite domain (the domain your email will appear to come from)
CMS_SMTP_REWRITE_DOMAIN=gmail.com
## Hostname that we should identify ourself to the remote server as
CMS_SMTP_HOSTNAME=gmail.com
## Can the From line be overridden in the outbound email
## NB GMail will rewrite the From address anyway so it's not important
## for GMail - YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_FROM_LINE_OVERRIDE=YES

## It is sometimes necessary to configure the webserver running inside
## the container to know the DNS name by which you will normally
## access the CMS. For most installations this is unnecessary and can
## be left as default, however, if you know this, it won't hurt to
## set it
CMS_SERVER_NAME=cms.example.org

## Xibo can email various reports and charts. To do so a charting service
## is required. Xibo uses QuickChart.io, which has been provided as a container
## in the Docker Compose files.
## If needed, you can change the URL of the Quick Chart service to one you provide
## externally to Xibo's Docker Compose environment
# CMS_QUICK_CHART_URL=http://cms-quickchart:3400
